		Quick Start demonstrates several features of JSON markup.
		First noticeable 'feature' is the presence of comments; both in
		single- and multi-line formats. To validate JSON markup, comments
		are stripped away before being loaded into the framework.
		
		Second are the sections. Each section has a purpose. While sections
		are not required to appear in the order as demonstrated in this
		and subsequent tutorials, such order is recommended as a general
		practice.
