    Quick Start demonstrates several features of JSON markup.
    1. comments: both in single- and multi-line formats. To 
       validate JSON markup, comments are stripped away before 
       being loaded into the engine.

    2. sections: while sections	are not required to appear in 
       the order shown in this and subsequent tutorials; however,
       it is recommended as a general practice.

    3. packed parameters: values take advantage of packing 
       parameters in a manner similar to CSS. Tutorials will
       demonstrate both packed and expanded varieties of 
       parameters.
