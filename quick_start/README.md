The recommended point of execution is `runner.py`. This script can execute in one of two ways.

*1 **`pyle.Bootstrap`** class can be instantiated and executed - either as default class or as inherited
*2 **`pyle.Application`** class can be instantiated and executed - either as default or as inherited

Executing from Bootstrap allows for more specialized configuration.`
